V1.5.0 - 20140610
=================

Sanji Controller:
- Add controller build-in model: Resource Dependency Model

V1.4.0 - 20140609
=================

Sanji Controller:
- Update subscribed QoS to 2
- Support ephemeral request
- Use ephemeral reuqest for register model
- Modify dispatch mechanism:

    All build-in model should get through routing mechanism
    to fulfill the standard protocol of resource and CRUD RESTful API.

    We dispatch procedure based on MQTT topic right now.
    (replace the old one, dispatch based on 'resource'.)

Functional Test:
- Seperate to V1.3.0 and V1.4.0(and later version)

    Since there are two big changes, we cannot use the old functional test case:
    * support ephemeral
	* modify dispatch mechanism

- Update subscribe keepalive to 3600s.
- Fix get hooked name bug when multiple hooks.
- Refactor code and naming.
